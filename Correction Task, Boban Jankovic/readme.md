#Task for a Job

Hello,

- For layout I used responsive float grid.

- I have finished the given task as I followed design from .psd files.

- I haven't used bootstrap or any icon pack, for icon I have used images from .psd design.

- For images i have used sprite image, SVG-IconFont, and images from design.

- Using preprocessor SCSS for styling components.

- I have used gulp, an open-source JavaScript toolkit to compile scss to css , live reloading, gulp-babel to compile JS es6 to es5.

- CSS files and JS files are minified by gulp-uglify.

- Breakpoints that i have used for building responsive layout : 
  -phone -> max-width:320px
  -phone-med -> max-width:480px
  -phone-big -> max-width:650px
  -tablet -> max-width:768px
  -tab-land -> max-width:1250px

- The smallest designed layout is on 320px screen width.
